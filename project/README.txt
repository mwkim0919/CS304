Introduction

The system is for customers, clerks, and managers to interact each other with a store's database.

Customers are allowed to create their accounts to access the store's database. They can search 
various items they want by giving upc, item type, item category, and etc. and they can also add
items that they would like to purchase someday into a shopping cart. Customers are allowed to
purchase the items in their shopping carts. When customers make their purchase, they have to give
their credit card, expiry date, their account id and password.

Clerks are allowed to make a return process for any purchased items only if the item's correct upc,
correct receipt ID, and quantity are given.

Managers are allowed to access the database that contains all information of items that are currently 
in stock. They are also allowed to add a new item to the store's stock and to update the expected
delivery dates for online order. They also have the access to a daily report which shows all items that
are sold on the date given each with quantity and amount. The report also shows the total amount of sale
on the given date.
